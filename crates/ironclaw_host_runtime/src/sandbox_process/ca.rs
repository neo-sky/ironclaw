//! Internal per-tenant CA for the sandbox egress proxy (W5 — design doc
//! `docs/plans/2026-07-26-sandbox-credential-firewall-design.md` §4).
//!
//! Generates a root key/cert pair **in memory only**, at construction, and
//! signs short-lived leaf certificates for hosts the credential firewall
//! (W6) intercepts. The root private key never touches disk, is never
//! serialized anywhere this module returns to a caller, and is never part
//! of anything mounted into a container — only
//! [`SandboxCertificateAuthority::root_certificate_pem`] (the public trust
//! anchor) is meant to reach the container filesystem, as a read-only
//! bind mount (W5's remaining trust-distribution work, see the design
//! doc's `update-ca-certificates` note). This is the same "secret material
//! never enters the container, in any form, even transiently" invariant
//! the rest of the credential firewall enforces, applied to the CA itself.
//!
//! **W6 is the consumer, not built yet.** Nothing in this crate calls
//! [`SandboxCertificateAuthority`] today; the proxy's TLS termination for
//! bound hosts will call [`SandboxCertificateAuthority::issue_leaf_for_host`]
//! per intercepted CONNECT, per the design doc's D1/W6 gating.
