//! Sandbox credential firewall — obligation-staging chokepoint (design
//! decision W8, `docs/plans/2026-07-26-sandbox-credential-firewall-design.md`
//! §2.2 "End-to-end flow", §2.3 "Placeholder vs grant lifetime", §3.3
//! "what JIT does NOT block", §3.4 "D2 mechanics").
//!
//! Models the same shape as
//! `ironclaw_extension_host::product_lifecycle::ExtensionLifecycleManager::activation_credential_requirements`:
//! a caller stages what an invocation is entitled to, ahead of the moment
//! that entitlement is actually consumed, and the consumer only ever sees a
//! yes/no answer — never a bypass to mint its own grant. There is exactly
//! one implementation; no trait exists here on purpose (an earlier design
//! pass considered one and rejected it as the over-engineering this design
//! explicitly guards against).
//!
//! **Why staged ahead of time, keyed by `(tenant_id, user_id)`.** The
//! consumer of this chokepoint is the shared egress proxy (its
//! connection-attribution resolver is W6 work, not built yet): it is
//! invoked per-TCP-connection and can resolve a peer IP to a
//! `{tenant, user}` (via `ConnectionAttributionResolver`), but
//! it has no way to recover which *invocation* opened that connection —
//! invocation identity simply is not present in anything the proxy can
//! observe from a TCP peer address. So the chokepoint cannot be a
//! request-time "ask which invocation this is" callback; it must be staged
//! ahead of the connection, under the one key the proxy actually has.
//!
//! **Fail-closed, with two distinct outcomes** (§3.4): a request over an
//! *established, attributed* connection with no live grant is a
//! [`SandboxCredentialDecision::NoGrant`] — GRANT-DENIAL, D5's "strip the
//! placeholder, forward the request bare, annotate output" — because the
//! origin's own 401/403 is a better error than blocking a public clone.
//! Everything else (attribution failed, or the lookup/callback did not
//! complete before its deadline) is [`SandboxCredentialFirewallError`] —
//! CONNECTION-DENIAL: deny the connection outright, never forward it. These
//! are deliberately different error shapes so a caller cannot collapse them
//! into a single fail-open branch by accident.
//!
//! **W8 is the chokepoint; W6 (proxy TLS termination) is the consumer, not
//! built yet.** Nothing in this crate calls into
//! [`SandboxCredentialFirewall`] today — it ships unwired, same as the
//! proxy's connection-attribution resolver, until the proxy is wired to
//! call it (profile-gated rollout per the design doc's PR strategy).
