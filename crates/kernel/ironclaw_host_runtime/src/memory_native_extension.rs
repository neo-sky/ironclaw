//! The bundled memory provider manifests (issue #3537).
//!
//! This module owns the host-bundled memory provider extensions — their v3
//! TOML manifests, the host service identities that back them, and the
//! functions that turn each bundled manifest into a registrable
//! [`ExtensionPackage`] plus its declared lifecycle
//! ([`BundledMemoryProvider`]).
//!
//! The BOUND provider is loaded on the **always-on first-party lane** (like
//! the builtin toolset), not the catalog/lifecycle lane: composition resolves
//! the compose-time `[memory]` binding, loads THAT provider's bundle, and
//! inserts its package directly into the extension registry at startup. There
//! is no install/enable lifecycle. Co-locating the manifests with the service
//! identities embodies the "bundled TOML alone is not authority" rule: each
//! manifest declares a `first_party` runtime whose `service` must match the
//! host-registered provider identity; the binding layer (`memory_binding`)
//! decides which provider serves, and the manifest's `[[tools]]` +
//! `[memory].lifecycle` are the single source of truth for that provider's
//! surface.
//!
//! The declared tools are model-visible memory tools under the stable
//! `ironclaw.memory.*` ids. Input schemas are served inline on the always-on
//! lane (see `first_party_tools::resolve_native_memory_input_schema_ref`), so
//! no asset materialization is required. The bound provider's
//! `[memory].guidance_doc` — its model-facing memory guidance, appended to the
//! system prompt by composition — is resolved the same way: generically,
//! against the asset table the provider BEING BUNDLED supplies to
//! [`memory_provider_bundle`], never by a host-side match on a specific
//! provider's constants. See [`BundledMemoryProvider::guidance`].
