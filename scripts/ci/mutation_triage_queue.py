"""Turn a cargo-mutants report into a self-contained triage queue.

Each surviving mutant becomes one entry carrying the sabotage diff and the
enclosing source, so whoever works the queue never has to go find the code.
That matters at scale: the queue is the unit of work, and an entry that
requires hunting is an entry that gets skipped or guessed at.

Verdict taxonomy is documented in docs/internal/mutation-audit.md. The
`needs-product-decision` verdict is load-bearing, not a cop-out: without it,
whoever works the queue will invent an intended contract and write a test
asserting it, which manufactures exactly the decorative coverage this audit
exists to find.
