# Prove that a new test actually kills the mutant it claims to kill.
#
# This is the acceptance gate for mutation-driven test work, and the reason the
# triage queue can be worked at scale without trusting anyone's judgement: the
# criterion is mechanical, not a review opinion.
#
# A fix is accepted only when BOTH hold:
#   1. the suite passes on unmodified code   (the test is not just broken)
#   2. the suite fails with the sabotage applied  (the test actually checks it)
#
# Condition 2 is what a decorative test cannot satisfy, and condition 1 is what
# a test reshaped to match current behaviour cannot satisfy. Together they
# reject both failure modes without a human reading the diff.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/mutation-verify-fix.sh -p <package> \
#       'crates/foo/src/bar.rs:80:5: replace baz with ()'
#
# The mutant string is copied verbatim from mutants.out/missed.txt or the
# triage queue.
#
# Options (env vars):
#   MUT_TIMEOUT=300   Per-mutant timeout in seconds (default: 300)
#
# Exit codes: 0 accepted · 1 rejected · 2 usage/tooling error

# copy is redirected at one absolute target directory, parallel jobs clobber
# each other's compiled artifacts and a job can run a test binary built from a
# different job's mutated source. The verdicts then come out wrong in BOTH
# directions — a killed mutant reported as surviving, and worse, a surviving
# mutant reported as caught. This was observed, not theorised: the same mutant
# reported MISSED with a shared dir and caught without one, on identical source.
# Correctness beats the warm cache for a tool whose only job is to be trusted.
